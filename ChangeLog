	* configure.ac: version number increased to 1.2.2

	* bloom.c (nsrl_bloom_query): b->key was being set when encryption was not enabled. This resulted in saved bloom filters not being readable. I wonder why no one caught this.

2009-07-05  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@imac2.local>

	* configure.ac: version upped to 1.2.1 Turns out that on Linux the blocksize was coming in as 1024 bytes but that a lot of the other code assumed 512-byte sectors.
